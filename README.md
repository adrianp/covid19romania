Main data source is the press office of the [Ministry of Internal Affairs](https://www.mai.gov.ro/category/comunicate-de-presa/), which currently provides a daily report on most metrics. Data points are also sourced from the Romanian Ministry of Health and the Romanian National Institute of Public Health and occasionally from news outlets. The purpose is to provide a historic overview of the various figures and not live information on the pandemic.
